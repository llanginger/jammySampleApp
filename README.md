# jammySampleApp

Please add the SDK to the app's main entry point, `App.js`. I have left some comments describing where to invoke the methods, will update with more detail if needed!

This sample project was created using `react-native init` - if you need any help running the file, there is good documentation available here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#creating-a-new-application but please feel free to ask me directly!
